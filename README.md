# An example of a simple application with the React Webpack.

## Webpack Dev Server:

To start the build in `development mode`, enter the following:

```bash
npm start
```

You will automatically open a tab with the address http://localhost:3000

## Build static files

After running the following commands:

- `development mode`:
  ```bash
  npm run build:dev
  ```
- `production mode`:
  ```bash
  npm run build:prod
  ```
  A `dist` folder with all static files will be generated in the root of the project.
